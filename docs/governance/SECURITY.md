- **Full paths of source files** related to the vulnerability
- **Location** of the affected code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Potential impact** of the vulnerability
- **Suggested remediation** (if you have ideas)

### Response Timeline

- **Within 24 hours**: Acknowledgment of your report

- **Within 30 days**: Patch development and testing
- **Within 45 days**: Public disclosure (coordinated with reporter)

### Severity Classification

We use CVSS 3.1 scoring:

- **Critical (9.0-10.0)**: Immediate action required
- **High (7.0-8.9)**: Prioritized for next release
- **Medium (4.0-6.9)**: Addressed in regular release cycle
- **Low (0.1-3.9)**: Backlog for future release

## Security Measures

### Infrastructure Security
